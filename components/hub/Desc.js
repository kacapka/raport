                Since January 2018, entities have had the opportunity to benefit from the Innovation Hub Programme operated by the KNF. The programme is designed for entities operating on the financial market, as well as for entities planning to start such activities.            </p>
            <p className="desc-text with-margin">
                As part of the Programme, the representatives of the KNF inform the entity (free of charge) about the way in which the provisions regulating the functioning of the financial market should be applied in the context of the entity’s business activity and they dispel any legal doubts it may have. The Programme also offers a direct working meeting at the seat of the KNF with representatives of the supervisory authority. It is an effective form of interaction with the KNF (or remote online meetings) during which all necessary information can be obtained at one single meeting.
            </p>

                Currently, the main areas covered by the entities’ inquiries are: payment services, cloud computing, investment crowdfunding, ICO, robot consulting and DLT/Blockchain issues.
