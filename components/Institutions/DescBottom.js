                Regardless of the formal conditions indicated above, the KNF verifies, before giving the authorisation/ licence, whether the presented documents and information enable to assume that the applicant company, its managers and shareholders holding a significant financial interest in the company, provide a guarantee of prudent and stable management of that entity. In case of justified doubts in this respect, the KNF may refuse to grant its consent to start business activity, taking into account the interest of its clients and the stability of the whole sector.

            <p className="desc-text">
                However, despite the lack of direct regulatory requirements, due to the protection of potential clients and the security of the financial system, the KNF verifies the credibility not only of the entities applying for the licence, but also of their significant shareholders. Experience in the establishment and operation of other regulated entities in the financial sector will increase the credibility of such shareholders or investors.
